**MLP-Regression-and-Classification**
**Overview**

This repository includes the implementation of a project using Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with Scikit-Learn on Google Colaboratory. The project encompasses MLP Regression for predicting California House Prices and MLP Classification using the Iris Dataset and MLP Regression for Housing and MLP Classification using Lower backpain Symptoms. I have attached the dataset for this.
