# Deep-Learning-Projects

**MLP-Regression-and-Classification**
**Overview**

This repository includes the implementation of a project using Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with Scikit-Learn on Google Colaboratory. The project encompasses MLP Regression for predicting California House Prices and MLP Classification using the Iris Dataset and MLP Regression for Housing and MLP Classification using Lower backpain Symptoms. I have attached the dataset for this.

**Implementation**

**Files**
1. MLP_Regression_California_Housing.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for MLP Regression with the California Housing Dataset.
2. MLP_Classification_Iris_Dataset.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for MLP Classification with the Iris Dataset.
3. MLP_Regression_Housing_Dataset.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for MLP Regression with the Housing Dataset.
4. MLP_Classification_Dataset_spine.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for MLP Classification with the Dataset_spine.
   
**Instructions**
1. Open the respective Jupyter Notebooks on Google Colab.
2. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially.
3. Save and download the notebook after execution.
